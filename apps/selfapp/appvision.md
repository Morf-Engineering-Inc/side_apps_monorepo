MAKE SURE your heart is in it and you have teh clear view of beocming over avchieving ... allowing the owrk to help become..
refine your view on wht is true success.
TrueOrient's One Thing:
"Shift your focus from achieving to becoming — ensuring your heart is aligned with love in every moment of work."
It's not about:

❌ Checking off tasks
❌ Hitting metrics
❌ Productivity hacks
❌ External validation

It's about:

✅ Who you're becoming through the work
✅ Why your heart is engaged (love vs. fear/ego)
✅ Redefining success as transformation, not accomplishment
✅ Letting the work refine you like fire refines silver

The one question TrueOrient asks:
"In this moment of work — is your heart aligned with love, and is this shaping who you're becoming?"
LinkedIn announcement (revised):
Your heart points somewhere in every moment. That direction determines who you become.

Launching TrueOrient — a tool that helps you shift from achieving to becoming.

It's not about checking off tasks. It's about making sure your heart is in the work, aligned with love rather than fear or ego. It's about redefining success: not what you accomplish, but who you become through the work.

Is that hitting the essence?
The Development of a Grand Character
“Day by day, hour by hour, man builds the character that will determine his place and standing among his associates throughout the ages. …

“… More important than riches, more enduring than fame, more precious than happiness is the possession of a noble character. Truly it has been said that the grand aim of man’s creation is the development of a grand character, and grand character is by its very nature the product of a probationary discipline” (“Man’s Soul Is As Endless As Time,” Instructor, January 1960, 1–2).

A Christlike Character
“What is the crowning glory of man in this earth so far as his individual achievement is concerned? It is character—character developed through obedience to the laws of life as revealed through the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who came that we might have life and have it more abundantly. Man’s chief concern in life should not be the acquiring of gold nor fame nor material possessions. It should not be the development of physical prowess nor of intellectual strength, but his aim, the highest in life, should be the development of a Christlike character” (“Obedience Develops Character,” Instructor, August 1965, 301).
What if the most important thing about any action isn't WHAT you're doing, but WHY you're doing it or HOW (your intent)?

Built TrueOrient to help answer that question. It's a tool for identifying motivations rooted in love rather than fear, ego, or obligation.

Your heart points somewhere in every moment. Make it count.
The Core Truth:
Your heart has a direction in every moment → that direction shapes your becoming
The Operating Principle:
WHY > WHAT (the motivation behind an action determines its transformative power)
The App's Job:
Help users identify and align with the right WHY - not just any motivation, but one that points them toward who they truly want to become
Orient - Align your why

TrueOrient - Align your heart to love
Bridle Passion → self-mastery
Submit Will → let God prevail
Orient Love → become Christlike

BUT — add a small gold highlight edge and fire and gold vibes liek old testiant purified as godl or sliver
You said:
Malachi 3:3
“He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.”

and
1 Peter 1:7
“your faith… tried with fire… more precious than gold.”

maybe even have tiers in the app for teh animations for logging
The app’s gem subtly refines over time — not because you achieve more, but because you repeatedly re-orient your heart toward love.
| name | hex | meaning |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| midnight black | `#0E0E11` | premium / depth / “the soul’s interior” |
| refiner gold | `#D8A950` | purification / godward light |
| ember orange | `#FF7A3B` | fire / testing / furnace glow |

The use of this app is to help a person NOTICE and REALIGN the direction of their love in real time — so their end result is who they BECAME, not just what they achieved.
you are building a love compass calibration tool.you just quoted Alma 38:12
Bridle passion self mastery submission to Gods will . Orient towards love.
“bridle all your passions,
that ye may be filled with love.”
the essence is:
Bridle your passions — self-mastery.
Submit your will — let God prevail.
Orient your heart — toward love.
your heart points somewhere in every moment.
that direction determines who you become.
here is your refined core — distilled and clarified — AFTER this latest iteration.

this is now clean, sharp, and unified:
reframed in modern “WHY movement” language:

secular: find your why

Bearing: orient your why toward love

## difference = vector

## NAME (brand):

**Bearing**

## ESSENCE (what the app actually does):

**Helps you notice and realign your heart’s direction in the moment.**

## TAGLINE (short):

**Making your WHY the right WHY.**

## THEOLOGICAL ROOT:

Elder Oaks — _The Challenge to Become_
Final judgment is about what we **become**, not just what we **do**.

## SCRIPTURAL FRAME:

Eph 4:13 — “measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ”

## OPERATIONAL TRIAD (your doctrine → UX):

**Bridle passion.
Submit will.
Orient love.
→ Become.**

| term       | meaning                       | scripture    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| **bridle** | govern passions (power)       | Alma 38:12   |
| **submit** | yield will to God             | Helaman 3:35 |
| **orient** | direct love toward God/others | 2 Tim 3:2–4  |

### each moment in the app is ONE calibration

→ not logging behavior
→ logging **direction of love**

---

## PRODUCT THESIS (1 sentence):

> **Bearing calibrates the compass of your love — in real time — so who you BECOME aligns with Christ, not just your accomplishments.**

---

## clean explanation sentence for app-store:

**Track not what you did — but what you were turning toward.**

---

## reframed in modern “WHY movement” language:

- secular: find your why
- Bearing: **orient your why toward love**

difference = vector

---

### so the whole idea in 16 words:

**Passion is fuel. Will is surrender. Love is direction.
Bearing helps you orient all three.**

---

this is now crisp enough to build UI.

next step (if you want):

**I write the exact 3 options that appear when the user taps ORIENT:**

- God-ward
- Self-ward
- Mixed / unclear

but phrased in **this** doctrinal triad language so it's beautiful + simple + touchable.

Here’s how to translate that into a single usable operating principle your app can actually implement:

the actionable core:

| Whatever I’m doing — WHY I’m doing it matters more than WHAT I’m doing. | secular “why movement”             | Bearing’s gospel enhancement |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| find your purpose                                                       | re-align your heart to love of God |
| be intentional                                                          | be Christ-centered                 |
| motivation drives action                                                | love drives becoming               |

Bearing helps you make your WHY the right WHY.
the use of the app is to help a person notice and realign the direction of their love in real time.
to move “unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ” — not by measuring outcomes, but by orienting love in the moment.

Use Correct Principles
Establish a set of guiding principles for your life from the teachings of Jesus Christ. Never compromise them. Difficulties in life begin when small deviations from true principles are made to justify a quick move to greater accomplishment. Over time, that pattern brings failure. Strength comes from making no exceptions to guiding principles.

Rigorous discipline is at the core of all significant attainment.

Success Is Gauged by Self-Mastery
President N. Eldon Tanner
First Counselor in the First Presidency

Solomon in all his wisdom made this meaningful statement: “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.” (Prov. 16:32.)
There are two important elements in self-mastery. The first is to determine your course or set the sails, so to speak, of moral standards; the other is the willpower, or the wind in the sails carrying one forward. As I said before, character is determined by the extent to which we can master ourselves toward good ends.
