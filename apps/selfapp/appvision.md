The use of this app is to help a person NOTICE and REALIGN the direction of their love in real time — so their end result is who they BECAME, not just what they achieved.
you are building a love compass calibration tool.you just quoted Alma 38:12
Bridle passion self mastery submission to Gods will . Orient towards love.
“bridle all your passions,
that ye may be filled with love.”
the essence is:
Bridle your passions — self-mastery.
Submit your will — let God prevail.
Orient your heart — toward love.
your heart points somewhere in every moment.
that direction determines who you become.
here is your refined core — distilled and clarified — AFTER this latest iteration.

this is now clean, sharp, and unified:
reframed in modern “WHY movement” language:

secular: find your why

Bearing: orient your why toward love

## difference = vector

## NAME (brand):

**Bearing**

## ESSENCE (what the app actually does):

**Helps you notice and realign your heart’s direction in the moment.**

## TAGLINE (short):

**Making your WHY the right WHY.**

## THEOLOGICAL ROOT:

Elder Oaks — _The Challenge to Become_
Final judgment is about what we **become**, not just what we **do**.

## SCRIPTURAL FRAME:

Eph 4:13 — “measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ”

## OPERATIONAL TRIAD (your doctrine → UX):

**Bridle passion.
Submit will.
Orient love.
→ Become.**

| term       | meaning                       | scripture    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| **bridle** | govern passions (power)       | Alma 38:12   |
| **submit** | yield will to God             | Helaman 3:35 |
| **orient** | direct love toward God/others | 2 Tim 3:2–4  |

### each moment in the app is ONE calibration

→ not logging behavior
→ logging **direction of love**

---

## PRODUCT THESIS (1 sentence):

> **Bearing calibrates the compass of your love — in real time — so who you BECOME aligns with Christ, not just your accomplishments.**

---

## clean explanation sentence for app-store:

**Track not what you did — but what you were turning toward.**

---

## reframed in modern “WHY movement” language:

- secular: find your why
- Bearing: **orient your why toward love**

difference = vector

---

### so the whole idea in 16 words:

**Passion is fuel. Will is surrender. Love is direction.
Bearing helps you orient all three.**

---

this is now crisp enough to build UI.

next step (if you want):

**I write the exact 3 options that appear when the user taps ORIENT:**

- God-ward
- Self-ward
- Mixed / unclear

but phrased in **this** doctrinal triad language so it's beautiful + simple + touchable.

Here’s how to translate that into a single usable operating principle your app can actually implement:

the actionable core:

| Whatever I’m doing — WHY I’m doing it matters more than WHAT I’m doing. | secular “why movement”             | Bearing’s gospel enhancement |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| find your purpose                                                       | re-align your heart to love of God |
| be intentional                                                          | be Christ-centered                 |
| motivation drives action                                                | love drives becoming               |

Bearing helps you make your WHY the right WHY.
the use of the app is to help a person notice and realign the direction of their love in real time.
to move “unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ” — not by measuring outcomes, but by orienting love in the moment.

Use Correct Principles
Establish a set of guiding principles for your life from the teachings of Jesus Christ. Never compromise them. Difficulties in life begin when small deviations from true principles are made to justify a quick move to greater accomplishment. Over time, that pattern brings failure. Strength comes from making no exceptions to guiding principles.

Rigorous discipline is at the core of all significant attainment.

Success Is Gauged by Self-Mastery
President N. Eldon Tanner
First Counselor in the First Presidency

Solomon in all his wisdom made this meaningful statement: “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.” (Prov. 16:32.)
There are two important elements in self-mastery. The first is to determine your course or set the sails, so to speak, of moral standards; the other is the willpower, or the wind in the sails carrying one forward. As I said before, character is determined by the extent to which we can master ourselves toward good ends.
